# N3AS Work
From January 2021 to July 2021, I was an undergraduate researcher at N3AS (Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries). I studied Neutrino Oscillations in vacuum and matter alongside Dr. Manibrata Sen. Here are three Jupyter notebooks that I created.
## DiffEQ's with Python
Studying the phenomena of Neutrino Oscillations requires the ability to solve complicated differential equations. Often, we choose to solve these differential equations numerically. In this notebook, I practice using `odeint`, which is a Python function that is a part of the `scipy` package that can be used to solve differential equations numerically. Throughout this notebook, I follow this excellent tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV3BnroVjZo - by APMonitor.com.
## Neutrino Oscillation Differential Equations
In this notebook, I derive and solve the differential equations describing Neutrino Flavour Oscillations and Mixing for varying initial conditions. The interesting sinusoidal nature of the survival probability of neutrinos is illustrated, and the phenomena of MSW resonance is also explored.
## Neutrino Oscillation Plots
In this notebook, I plot several functions that describe how neutrinos oscillate in different scenarios (vacuum, matter). I include plots wherein I start in all three neutrino flavors and plot the survival and oscillation probabilities for all end states (for example, if the neutrino started as an electron neutrino, I plotted the probabilities of it staying an electron neutrino and becoming tau and muon neutrinos on the same axis).
