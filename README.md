# N3AS Work
From January 2021 to July 2021, I was an undergraduate researcher at N3AS (Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries). I studied Neutrino Oscillations in vacuum and matter alongside Dr. Manibrata Sen. Here are three Jupyter notebooks that I created.
## DiffEQ's with Python
Studying the phenomena of Neutrino Oscillations requires the ability to solve complicated differential equations. Often, we choose to solve these differential equations numerically. In this notebook, I practice using `odeint`, which is a Python function that is a part of the `scipy` package that can be used to solve differential equations numerically. Throughout this notebook, I follow this excellent tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV3BnroVjZo
## Neutrino Oscillation Differential Equations
In this notebook, I derive and solve the differential equations describing Neutrino Flavour Oscillations and Mixing for varying initial conditions
## Neutrino Oscillation Plots
In this notebook, I plot several functions that describe how neutrinos oscillate in different scenarios (vacuum, matter).
